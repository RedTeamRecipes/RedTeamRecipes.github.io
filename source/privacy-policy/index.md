This site (https://www.redteamrecipes.com) is operated by the RedTeam Recipes collective. We keep the footprint small: no ad tech, no third‑party analytics, and only the minimum data required to run static pages and reply to emails.

## Web Logs
When you browse the site we log the usual web server telemetry-IP address, user agent, referrer, and the path requested. Logs rotate within 30 days and are used strictly for performance, abuse troubleshooting, or mandatory legal requests.

## Email and Submissions
If you email `contact@redteamrecipes.com` or `sponsorship@redteamrecipes.com`, the message and your address are stored in our inbox provider so we can reply. We never sell or share submissions; access is limited to the core RTR coordinators. If you request deletion, we remove the thread unless retention is required by law or an active engagement.

## Community Channels
We maintain community spaces on Reddit, Telegram, and X. These platforms have their own privacy policies and may collect additional data beyond our control. Only share what you are comfortable posting on those services.

## Cookies and Tracking
We does not set cookies by default and we do not inject any trackers, pixels, or fingerprinting scripts. If we embed external media in the future (video players, code sandboxes, etc.) we will update this page with the relevant disclosures.

## Data Requests
To request log deletion, remove an email thread, or ask any privacy-related question, contact [contact@redteamrecipes.com](mailto:contact@redteamrecipes.com). Please include enough context (approximate timestamp, channel used) so we can locate the data.

This policy will evolve as we add new features. Significant changes will be summarized on the home page and dated revisions will be noted here.

<!-- Use this FAQ hub to address common questions—submission guidelines, how to request a write-up, or what tooling is allowed in public posts.

### How do I submit a recipe?
Send an email to `contact@example.com` with the objective, tooling, and detection notes. We reply within 3 business days.

### Can I stay anonymous?
Yes. Share the details privately and we’ll work out attribution levels that match your policies.

### What labs do you accept?
Anything you can legally run: cloud ranges, on-prem replicas, or hybrid environments. Just include repro steps.

### Are there publishing rules?
Nothing weaponized. Stick to research-grade content with clear detection countermeasures. -->

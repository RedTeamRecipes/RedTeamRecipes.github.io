We deliver offensive security services that match the same depth you see in every RedTeam Recipes post. Every engagement is run by practitioners who publish their research here, ensuring the work stays practical, transparent, and battle-tested.

## Penetration Testing
- **Web Applications** – Manual exploit development, business-logic abuse, and chained findings that mimic real adversaries.
- **Mobile Applications** – Reverse-engineering and dynamic analysis for iOS and Android, including API abuse and supply-chain checks.
- **Network & Infrastructure** – Internal and external campaigns covering AD misconfigurations, cloud footholds, and lateral movement paths.
- **Red Team Assessments** – Goal-oriented operations with stealth tooling, custom malware, and purple-team knowledge transfer.

Each report includes replayable PoC steps, mitigation guidance, and executive summaries tailored to stakeholders.

## CTF & Event Creation
Need to challenge your team or community? We design full-spectrum CTFs and live-fire ranges:

- Scenario design aligned with your industry or threat model.
- Custom infrastructure with automated scoring, hints, and monitoring dashboards.
- Facilitator guides, solution write-ups, and optional on-site or remote support.

## How to Engage
1. Send a short brief to [sponsorship@redteamrecipes.com](mailto:sponsorship@redteamrecipes.com) with your objectives, target scope, and desired timeline.
2. We schedule a scoping call with the operators who will run the project—no sales hand-offs.
3. You receive a phased proposal outlining deliverables, pricing, and knowledge-transfer milestones.

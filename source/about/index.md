## Who we are 
We are a collective of Arab offensive security engineers united by a shared obsession with understanding and outsmarting complex systems.
RedTeam Recipes (RTR) was born from that passion: a place to publish high-quality offensive security blogs, research, and field notes that dig deep into real adversarial techniques.

We believe in learning by doing, documenting what works, and pushing technical boundaries responsibly. Every post on RTR comes straight from practical experience tested, broken, rebuilt, and served fresh for the community.

## Our Mission
The Arab cybersecurity scene is full of talent but also full of noise.
Scammers, fake “experts,” and recycled low-quality content have drowned out the voices of genuine professionals. Valuable research often goes unseen, hidden beneath layers of hype and algorithm-driven nonsense.

RedTeam Recipes (RTR) exists to change that.
We built RTR as a home for authentic, high-quality offensive security knowledge not clickbait. We collect, refine, and publish real work from real practitioners.
By filtering out the noise, we aim to create a trusted space for professionals, a platform where skill, integrity, and technical excellence define the standard.

## Teammates
RedTeam Recipes (RTR) **isn’t owned by a single person or company** it’s a collective.
Any Arab security professional or content creator producing real, high-quality offensive security work is welcome here. **RTR is an open-source initiative** built to raise the level of technical depth, honesty, and professionalism across the Arab cybersecurity space.

We believe collaboration beats competition.
If you share that vision if you’re tired of noise and want to build something meaningful you’re already one of us.
